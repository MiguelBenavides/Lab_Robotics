    "### Introduction <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following lab consists on image edge detection. This feature allows us to detect the edge of an object in order to identify what it is and categorize it for image detection purposes. As explained by the teacher, the origin of edges in an image may come from factors such as surface normal discontinuity, depth discontinuity, surface color discontinuity, and illumination discontinuity. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, to determine if a certain pixel of an image is  an edge, pixels must be compared, more technically, edges are steep cliffs or steep changes occurring somewhere in the image function, edges represent steep changes in pixel values intensities. This lab is about different techniques of identifying the edges of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure <a name=\"procedure\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this practice, as well as the previous ones, the following tools are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Raspberry Pi with WiFi connection capabilities\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "* Python >= 3.5.2\n",
    "* OpenCV 3.2\n",
    "* Git\n",
    "* GitHub account\n",
    "* Markdown editor (recommended: ReText 5.3.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The base codes for this practice were provided by the instructor but the authors of this report also contributed to the program in order to accomplish the desired objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Gradient <a name=\"gradient\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The  gradient  method  detects  the  edges  by  looking  for  the  maximum  and  minimum  in  the  first  derivative  of  the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sobel operator <a name=\"sobel\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator consists of a pair of 3x3 convolution kernels. One kernel is simply the other rotated by 90°. These  kernels  are  designed  to  respond  to edges  running  vertically  and  horizontally relative to the pixel  grid,  one  kernel  for  each  of  the  two  perpendicular  orientations.  The  kernels  can  be  applied  separately  to the  input  image,  to  produce  separate  measurements  of  the  gradient  component  in  each  orientation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Roberts operator <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Roberts Cross operator consists of a pair of 2×2 convolution kernels. One kernel is simply the other rotated by 90°. This is very similar to the Sobel operator but these kernels are designed to respond to edges running at 45° to the pixel grid, one kernel for each of the two perpendicular orientations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prewitt operator <a name=\"prewitt\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Prewitt operator is similar to the Sobel operator and is used for detecting vertical and horizontal edges in images. "

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Laura: I found this lab was very complex mathematically, running the code helped a lot to understand the differences between the methods explained. Each method has its own strengths and the use of each one is determined by the image desired to contour. Edge detection is the initial step in object recognition, so it is important to know the differences between edge detection techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Miguel: With the help of this laboratory, I learned how to detect the edge of figures inside images. There are several ways to do it, meaning several kernels that affect the sensitivity of edge detection, for example, Scharr is very sensitive of pixel density values, so even light edges will be detected, while Roberts is not very sensitive, so only rough edges will be detected. I learned this methodologies on a deep understanding, and was able to apply my knowledge to further extend and improve the provided code.\n",
