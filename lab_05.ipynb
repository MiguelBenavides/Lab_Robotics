    "### Lab 5: Blending images and measuring code performance\n",
    "Authors: Laura Morales, Miguel Benavides\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The following practice consists on analyzing images in order to get their properties such as number of channels and image resolution, we will also work with retrieving intensity values of pixels, setting a region of interest, blending images, performing bitwise operations, and measuring the performance of your code. This report will be divided in three different codes. The first one consists, on adding images, the second one is about blending images, and the third one is about analyzing the code performance. More specific detalis about each code will be provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "For this practice, the following tools were required:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Raspberry Pi with WiFi connection capabilities\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "* Python >= 3.5.2\n",
    "* OpenCV 3.2\n",
    "* Git\n",
    "* GitHub account\n",
    "* Markdown editor (recommended: ReText 5.3.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The base codes for each part of the practice were provided by the instructor but the authors of this report also contributed to the program in order to accomplish the desired objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding images\n",
    "\n",
    "This program consists on the addition or overlay of two images. The objective of this program is to use both possible methods to accomplish this superimposition and compare them to see if there are any differences. Firstable we need to import both images (a validation of this process was added so that the program wouldn't run unless it had an image), then both images were converted to RGB using a method previously learned, and finally, both images were added by the `add()` method from the cv2 library, and the `+` from the numpy library, both of the original images and the superimposed ones were displayed to show the results.

    "This practice was useful to learn the different methods to overlay an image, which is something very popular this day, there are a lot of apps that use filters that are basically overlapping colors into an image, a well as editing its parameters. The third code is useful to processing time requirements when working with large programs. "
